# Each environment below will generate a unique build/test job
# See the "compute-matrix" job in the workflow for how this is parsed and used
# cuda: The CUDA Toolkit version
# os: The operating system used
# cpu: The CPU architecture
# compiler: The compiler to use
#   name: The compiler name
#   version: The compiler version
#   exe: The unverionsed compiler binary name
#   To use the system's default compiler set "exe: 'c++'" or "name: 'cc'"
# gpu_build_archs: The GPU architectures to build for (comma-separated list)
# std: The C++ standards to build for
#    This field is unique as it will generate an independent build/test job for each value

    # There is currently only one CUDA 11.8 image available which comes with the system's default C++ compiler. For ubuntu22.04, we know that the default CC is gcc11.3
